            from 150 different political sources, including parties and individual politicians, offer insights into the

    <p class="c0 c5"><span class="c17"></span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c20">Introduction</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">In recent years, the political landscape of Georgia has increasingly been
            influenced by the dynamics of social media. This report details a study that delves into these dynamics,
            specifically focusing on the aspect of political polarisation as reflected through social media channels.
            The relevance of this study is underscored by Georgia&#39;s ongoing efforts to align with the European
            Union&#39;s standards and practices, a key aspect of which involves understanding and addressing the factors
            that contribute to political division.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">The significance of social media in shaping public opinion and political
            narratives in Georgia cannot be overstated. As such, this study aims to provide an analytical perspective on
            the nature of political conversations and debates occurring on these digital platforms. By doing so, it
            seeks to uncover the underlying patterns and trends that characterise political polarisation in the
            country.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">Key to this analysis is the exploration of the different narratives and
            viewpoints that emerge from Georgia&#39;s political entities, including both parties and individual
            politicians. The study is not limited to identifying these various discourses but also aims to trace their
            development and influence over a specified period. Such an understanding is pivotal for stakeholders
            involved in Georgian politics, offering insights that could inform strategies to foster a more unified
            political environment conducive to the country&#39;s EU aspirations.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">In this report, we outline the methods used in our analysis, present our key
            findings, and discuss their implications. The objective is to contribute meaningfully to the discourse
            surrounding political polarisation in Georgia, providing a resource for policymakers, academics, and others
            interested in the intersection of politics, social media, and international relations.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c5 c38" id="h.g1g8d7vojixt"><span class="c20">Political polarisation in Georgian and EU
            Integration</span></h2>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">The context of political polarisation in Georgia is deeply intertwined with the
            nation&#39;s aspirations for European Union integration. Since gaining independence, Georgia has embarked on
            a transformative journey, to align its political, economic, and social structures with those of the European
            Union. This path towards integration is not just a foreign policy objective but is also enshrined in the
            Georgian Constitution, reflecting a commitment that spans the political spectrum.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">However, the road to EU integration is multifaceted and challenging, with
            political polarisation emerging as a significant obstacle. Political polarisation, defined by the increasing
            ideological distance between political entities and the public, can hinder constructive dialogue, impede
            consensus-building, and challenge democratic processes. In the context of Georgia&#39;s EU aspirations, such
            polarisation can potentially affect the nation&#39;s ability to meet the EU&#39;s democratic standards and
            criteria for membership.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">The impact of political polarisation in Georgia extends beyond parliamentary
            debates and political rallies; it is vividly manifested on social media platforms. These digital arenas have
            become battlegrounds where political narratives and counter-narratives are continuously shaped and reshaped.
            Social media&#39;s role in amplifying polarisation is particularly noteworthy given its widespread use in
            Georgia for political discourse and public engagement.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">The European Union&#39;s perspective on Georgia&#39;s political polarisation is
            twofold. Firstly, it views reducing polarisation as essential for strengthening democratic institutions and
            governance in Georgia, which are prerequisites for EU integration. Secondly, the EU considers the management
            of political polarisation as critical for ensuring stability and harmony within its potential future member
            states. Consequently, understanding the nuances of this polarisation becomes pivotal for both Georgia and
            the EU.</span></p>

                to 150 valid accounts from platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and Telegram. These accounts were

    </h4>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">The study of the role oligarchs play in Georgia&#39;s political scene, especially
            the views towards Bidzina Ivanishvili between 2020 and 2023, shows a lot of action and involvement from the
            main political parties. In the early years of 2020 and 2021, the Georgian Labour Party was at the forefront
            of the opposition to Ivanishvili, engaging a lot of people with their posts. However, it&#39;s interesting
            to see that the Georgian Dream party, even with fewer posts supporting Ivanishvili, managed to get a lot
            more positive reactions, suggesting they might have a wider or more active group of supporters. Moving into
            2022, the United National Movement took over the leading role in challenging Ivanishvili, both in the sheer
            number of posts and the level of engagement they received, pointing to a change in the political dynamics
            and where the main resistance was coming from.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">What stands out from this analysis is the clear gap in positive responses between
            the parties and their stance on Ivanishvili. For example, in 2021, Georgian Dream&#39;s fewer supportive
            posts got more than 7.9 million positive reactions, overshadowing the opposition&#39;s numbers by a large
            margin. This difference in responses sheds light on the intricate nature of Georgia&#39;s political
            conversations, showing that the amount of posts doesn&#39;t always match up with how much or how strongly
            people respond. This gives us a closer look into the political division caused by oligarchic influences in
            Georgia, focusing on the depth and range of people&#39;s reactions rather than just how much they&#39;re
            talking.</span></p>

            polarisation</span></h4>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">The study of how political narratives in Georgia assign blame for increasing
            political division reveals two main viewpoints: those criticising the government and those criticising the
            opposition. Throughout this period, the United National Movement (UNM) consistently pointed fingers at the
            government, reaching a peak in 2022 with 728 posts that attracted a mix of positive and negative attention.
            This ongoing criticism highlights the UNM&#39;s role as a key opponent of government policies, indicating
            significant disagreements in the political conversation.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">On the other side, the Georgian Dream and People&#39;s Power were the most vocal
            in criticising the opposition, with the Georgian Dream leading this narrative for three consecutive years.
            In 2021, their messages received over 7.9 million positive engagements, a number that stands out within this
            debate, showing not just a high level of activity but also significant interaction, suggesting the
            party&#39;s success in engaging or appealing to a wide audience. In 2023, People&#39;s Power took the lead
            in opposing the opposition, with 785 posts, although these did not engage people as much as Georgian
            Dream&#39;s efforts in previous years. This change points to evolving dynamics in Georgia&#39;s political
            discussions, with different parties becoming more prominent in directing the conversation about political
            divisions.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">This examination sheds light on the specific roles and tactics of the leading
            political parties in Georgia&#39;s politically divided environment, highlighting the fervour and involvement
            in discussions about the responsibilities of government and opposition in deepening these divides.</span>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">The conversation about the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia, especially in
            terms of who was at fault, shows an active and changing pattern of engagement. Early on, the Georgian Dream
            party was particularly vocal in blaming Russia, drawing significant attention and suggesting their viewpoint
            had wide appeal. Interestingly, this party also presented views blaming Georgia, though less frequently,
            showing a more complex or varied take on the war&#39;s events.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">As time went on, the United National Movement became the main group discussing
            Russia&#39;s faults, in line with their political views and the historical backdrop. On the other hand,
            People&#39;s Power and the Conservative Party of Georgia stepped up as the main voices in 2023 and 2022,
            respectively, pointing towards Georgian responsibility, but these perspectives didn&#39;t capture as much
            engagement as those blaming Russia. This change might indicate shifts in political focus, strategies, or how
            the public feels about the war&#39;s impact.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">This analysis reveals a clear lean towards narratives that fault Russia, with a
            smaller yet persistent conversation that suggests Georgian responsibility. These dynamics highlight how the
            2008 war remains a key topic in Georgia, underlining the complexities of how history is seen and the
            influence political parties have in driving and engaging with these discussions.</span></p>

    <h4 class="c16" id="h.32y6de9qainl"><span class="c21 c8">Attitude toward West</span></h4>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">The discussion about Georgia&#39;s foreign policy direction, choosing between
            Pro-Western and Anti-Western stances, shows a clear divide and engagement across political lines. The
            Georgian Dream party consistently pushed for closer ties with the West, with their efforts peaking in 2022
            with 938 posts, highlighting their commitment to Western integration despite a slight dip in activity in
            2023. This shows their deliberate effort to gather support for this path.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">In contrast, the Conservative Party of Georgia took a leading role in opposing
            Western alignment in the latter two years, with a noticeable jump in posts from 2023 to 538, signalling a
            strong push against Western orientation. This rise in anti-Western sentiment may suggest a widening gap in
            public and political opinion on Georgia&#39;s foreign policy choices. The level of engagement, especially
            the support for Georgian Dream&#39;s pro-Western stance, points to the intense debate over Georgia&#39;s
            place in global geopolitics and the influence of political parties in steering this conversation.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">Through this lens, the analysis highlights a polarised view on foreign policy,
            with significant discussions on whether to pursue closer relations with the West or oppose them. The sharp
            difference in the number of posts between advocates for Western integration and those against it illustrates
            the deepening fault lines and changing dynamics in how Georgia navigates its geopolitical ambitions and
            challenges.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c5"><span class="c39 c26"></span></p>
    <h5 class="c32" id="h.jpb0jfjikuno"><span class="c31">West advocacy</span></h5>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">The investigation into pro-West narratives within Georgian political discourse
            uncovers a multifaceted picture of engagement, reflecting a diversity of views and the complexity of
            Georgia&#39;s orientation towards Western alliances. The analysis reveals that pro-West posts, both those
            receiving high positive and negative engagement, predominantly emanate from a limited range of political
            parties. This suggests that support for Western integration is a polarising issue, closely tied to specific
            political ideologies and agendas within the country.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">Posts with high positive engagement tend to celebrate Western democratic values,
            emphasising the benefits of integration with European and North American institutions for Georgia&#39;s
            democracy, economy, and security. These narratives often highlight the importance of aligning with the West
            as a strategic choice for ensuring Georgia&#39;s progress and stability, invoking themes of liberty, human
            rights, and economic development. On the other hand, pro-West posts that attract high negative engagement
            reveal a contentious debate within Georgian society. Critics within these discussions frequently question
            the sincerity or effectiveness of Western support, the conditions attached to Western integration, or the
            potential loss of national identity and autonomy. Yet, even within this critical engagement, the underlying
            premise of a Westward orientation is not entirely dismissed but rather debated in terms of its terms and
            implications.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">Throughout the period analysed, the persistence and evolution of pro-West
            narratives with significant engagement levels underscore the salience of Western integration in
            Georgia&#39;s political and public discourse. While the support for Western ties is clear among certain
            parties and segments of the population, the nuances within this support reflect a broader conversation about
            what such an orientation means for Georgia&#39;s future. This dialogue is characterised by both optimism for
            the potential benefits of closer ties with the West and caution about the challenges and compromises these
            ties may entail.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c39 c26"></span></p>
    <h5 class="c32" id="h.328sqvoe1l73"><span class="c21 c30">West opposition</span></h5>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">The analysis of anti-West narratives within the dataset reveals a complex
            landscape of engagement across different political parties in Georgia, characterised by varied responses to
            the discourse opposing Western integration. Notably, the most engaged anti-West posts, both positively and
            negatively, often originate from a select few parties, suggesting a polarisation within the political
            spectrum concerning Georgia&#39;s orientation towards Western alliances.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c17">In terms of content, posts with the highest negative engagement frequently criticise
            Western policies or influence in Georgia, framing them as detrimental to the nation&#39;s sovereignty or
            traditional values. These narratives may leverage geopolitical events, cultural debates, or economic
            policies to argue against closer ties with Western entities. Conversely, the positively engaged posts within
            the anti-West discourse tend to emphasise national autonomy, cultural preservation, and the importance of
            balancing international relations with maintaining Georgia&#39;s unique identity and interests. While
            critical of the West, these posts might also call for a nuanced approach to diplomacy, suggesting that
            alignment with Western values or policies should not be pursued uncritically or at the expense of
            Georgia&#39;s autonomy and welfare.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">Across the years, the persistence of anti-West narratives with high engagement
            levels highlights a significant segment of the Georgian population that is sceptical of closer ties with
            Western institutions. This scepticism spans across multiple parties, though it is more pronounced within
            certain factions, indicating a political strategy that capitalises on nationalistic sentiments and concerns
            over sovereignty. The discourse&#39;s evolution or consistency over the years could reflect broader
            geopolitical shifts, domestic policy debates, or changes in the public&#39;s perception of Western influence
            in Georgia. &#8203;</span></p>

    <h4 class="c16" id="h.iny6dusjc98m"><span class="c21 c8">Attitude toward Russia</span></h4>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">The discussion on Georgia&#39;s foreign policy stance towards Russia showcases the
            shifting political and ideological lines within the nation. The United National Movement (UNM) has been at
            the forefront of criticising Russian influence, with their efforts intensifying over the years&mdash;jumping
            from 206 posts in 2021 to 659 in 2023. This increase underlines the UNM&#39;s focus on opposing Russian
            influence, a stance that ties into their larger goal of reinforcing Georgian sovereignty and pursuing closer
            ties with the West.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">On the flip side, support for Russia within Georgia presents a diverse scenario.
            Initially, the Alliance of Patriots of Georgia and Georgian Dream participated in pro-Russian narratives.
            Later, People&#39;s Power and the Conservative Party of Georgia stood out for their Russian support in 2023
            and 2022, though their presence was smaller compared to the anti-Russian messages. The volume of posts
            criticising Russian influence, particularly from the UNM, and the mixed reactions these received, highlight
            the intense debate over Georgia&#39;s foreign policy. This debate separates those pushing for stronger
            connections with the West from those seen as leaning towards Russian interests.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">This analysis points to a deeply divided and increasingly vocal debate over
            Georgia&#39;s direction in foreign policy, underlining significant divides in political and public opinion
            about the country&#39;s strategic path. The growing focus on anti-Russian sentiments, mainly driven by the
            UNM, indicates a strong movement against Russian influence, mirroring larger geopolitical tensions and the
            lasting effect of past conflicts on Georgia&#39;s current political and foreign policy discourse.</span></p>

    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">The analysis of anti-Russia narratives within Georgian political discourse
            underscores a critical aspect of the nation&#39;s geopolitical stance and public sentiment, reflecting
            deep-seated concerns and opposition towards Russian influence and policies. The engagement patterns with
            these narratives, both positive and negative, reveal a wide consensus among several political parties,
            indicating a broad-based scepticism and resistance against Russia&#39;s regional ambitions and its impact on
            Georgia&#39;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">Posts with the highest positive engagement in the anti-Russia category often
            articulate concerns about Russian geopolitical manoeuvres, historical grievances, and the ongoing conflicts
            in regions recognized internationally as part of Georgia but currently under Russian control or influence.
            These narratives emphasise the importance of national security, the integrity of Georgian territory, and the
            need for international support to counter Russian aggression. They resonate with calls for solidarity, the
            protection of human rights, and the reinforcement of Georgian national identity against perceived external
            threats.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">Conversely, posts that attract high negative engagement within the anti-Russia
            discourse tend to focus on the complexities of Georgian-Russian relations, including economic dependencies,
            the nuanced realities of conflict zones, and the challenges of diplomatic engagement with Russia. While
            these posts share a critical stance towards Russia, the debate often centres on the best strategies for
            addressing these challenges, balancing national security concerns with the realities of economic and social
            ties between the two countries.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">Throughout the analysis period, the enduring focus on anti-Russia narratives with
            significant engagement levels highlights the centrality of Russian relations in Georgia&#39;s political and
            public discourse. The nuanced differences in engagement suggest a society grappling with its complex
            relationship with Russia, united in its opposition to Russian policies perceived as aggressive or
            imperialistic, yet divided on the best path forward for Georgia&#39;s future security, prosperity, and
            territorial integrity.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <h5 class="c32" id="h.wkwo6rxtasnn"><span class="c21 c30">Supporting deeper ties with Russia</span></h5>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">The exploration of pro-Russia narratives within Georgian political discourse
            highlights a nuanced and often contentious aspect of Georgia&#39;s geopolitical dialogue. This analysis
            reveals that while the support for Russia and its policies may be less vocal or mainstream compared to
            pro-Western sentiments, it nonetheless occupies a significant niche within certain political parties and
            segments of Georgian society. The engagement patterns for these narratives, both positive and negative,
            provide insight into the complexity of Georgian attitudes towards Russia.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">Pro-Russia posts with the highest positive engagement often articulate a vision
            of Georgia-Russia relations that emphasises historical ties, cultural connections, and potential economic
            benefits. These narratives sometimes critique the West&#39;s influence in Georgia, proposing that closer
            relations with Russia could offer alternative pathways to security and prosperity. They appeal to a sense of
            regional pragmatism, suggesting that cooperation with Russia is not only historically grounded but also
            geopolitically astute given Georgia&#39;s location and economic realities.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">Conversely, the narratives that attract high negative engagement within the
            pro-Russia discourse often provoke debate about the implications of such a stance for Georgia&#39;s
            sovereignty and territorial integrity. These discussions reflect the deep divisions within Georgian society
            regarding the best approach to dealing with Russia, especially in light of ongoing conflicts and territorial
            disputes. The negative engagement likely stems from a broader societal resistance to any perceived
            concessions to Russian influence, reflecting ongoing tensions and unresolved issues stemming from past
            conflicts.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c17">Throughout the period analysed, the presence and engagement with pro-Russia
            narratives underscore a complex landscape of opinion within Georgia, where historical affiliations, economic
            considerations, and geopolitical strategies converge. While a majority of the political discourse may lean
            towards pro-Western and anti-Russian sentiments, the existence and engagement levels of pro-Russia posts
            highlight a counter-narrative that advocates for a reconsideration of Georgia&#39;s relationship with its
            larger neighbour. This dialogue suggests an ongoing debate about Georgia&#39;s national identity, security
            concerns, and geopolitical orientation, reflecting the broader challenges faced by the country at the
            crossroads of Europe and Asia.</span></p>

    </h4>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">The conversation about Mikheil Saakashvili&#39;s custody and treatment,
            highlighting support (Saakashvili Defense) versus opposition (Saakashvili Criticism), showcases a deeply
            divided and active political scene in Georgia from 2020 to 2023. The United National Movement (UNM),
            Saakashvili&#39;s party, has been the most steadfast in defending him, with their efforts growing from 128
            posts in 2020 to 650 by 2023. This growth in activity clearly shows the party&#39;s dedication to supporting
            Saakashvili, indicating both a political strategy and an effort to rally support for his cause.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">Criticism has seen varied leadership, with Georgian Dream stepping up in 2021 and
            People&#39;s Power leading in 2023, the latter posting 376 criticisms in that year. These changes, along
            with the level of interaction these criticisms received, suggest a lively and evolving debate over
            Saakashvili&#39;s impact and current predicament. The engagement levels, particularly for narratives
            defending Saakashvili, spearheaded by the UNM, emphasise Saakashvili&#39;s continued relevance in Georgian
            political discussions, acting as a catalyst for wider debates on justice, potential political targeting, and
            governance principles. The persistent and increasing support for Saakashvili, contrasted with the changing
            critics, reflects the ongoing split and lasting importance of Saakashvili&#39;s story in the context of
            Georgia&#39;s current political landscape.</span></p>

    <h4 class="c16" id="h.iqv5zdcp80ho"><span class="c8 c21">The confrontation between liberal and conservative
            values</span></h4>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">The debate between liberal and conservative values in Georgia, viewed through
            Liberal versus Conservative Advocacy, shows a dynamic and evolving dialogue within the political sphere.
            Early on, in 2020, the discussions appeared evenly matched, with Lelo and Georgian Dream representing the
            liberal and conservative sides, respectively. This period marked the beginning of an engaging conversation
            on these ideological differences. Moving into 2021, the landscape began to change significantly.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">The United National Movement (UNM) took a leading role in championing liberal
            values in 2021 and 2023, drawing considerable attention and support. This shift highlights the UNM&#39;s
            commitment to liberal ideologies and its efforts to gather backing for these views. Meanwhile, on the
            conservative side, the Conservative Party of Georgia saw a notable uptick in its activities in 2022 and
            2023, delivering a large number of messages in support of conservative principles, surpassing the volume of
            liberal messaging. This increase underscores the Conservative Party of Georgia&#39;s focus on conservative
            values and indicates a deepening divide and the importance of value-driven politics in Georgia.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">This overview underlines the lively and divided nature of ideological debates in
            Georgia, particularly with the recent surge in support for conservative values. The difference in engagement
            and the volume of conservative advocacy by the Conservative Party of Georgia highlights a vigorous and
            potentially divisive ideological environment, which is shaping public conversations and may influence wider
            societal and political discussions.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <h5 class="c32" id="h.oe8zajrlqs9x"><span class="c21 c30">&nbsp;Liberal Advocacy </span></h5>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">The discourse surrounding liberal values in Georgia, highlights a vibrant debate
            on the topic, marked by significant engagement from various segments of society. Posts championing liberal
            values&mdash;ranging from human rights, and gender equality, to freedom of expression&mdash;garnered
            substantial engagement, indicating a robust public interest in liberal ideologies. This interest was not
            confined to a single party or year but was a recurrent theme across multiple political entities and
            throughout the period studied. The positive engagement with these posts often came from younger
            demographics, urban populations, and those with a pro-European orientation, who view liberal values as
            integral to Georgia&#39;s democratic development and its aspirations towards European
            integration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c23">However, the negative engagement these posts received unveils a contrasting
            perspective prevalent among more conservative factions within Georgian society, who may view rapid liberal
            reforms as a threat to traditional values or national identity. This divergence in public opinion is
            reflective of the broader cultural and political discourse in Georgia, where the tension between progressive
            ideals and traditional norms continues to shape the political landscape. Despite the contentious nature of
            these discussions, the engagement levels underscore a healthy democratic process, with social media serving
            as a vital platform for dialogue and debate. The analysis further reveals that while no single party
            monopolises the discourse on liberal values, certain parties are more actively engaged in promoting these
            ideals, suggesting a correlation between party ideology and advocacy for liberal reforms</span></p>
    <h5 class="c32" id="h.u0v2xtg6h321"><span class="c31">Conservative Advocacy</span></h5>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">The narrative around conservative values in Georgian political and social
            discourse, as evidenced by social media engagement, reflects a society grappling with its cultural identity
            amidst modern global influences. Posts that articulated conservative positions&mdash;emphasising traditional
            family values, national identity, and scepticism towards rapid liberal reforms&mdash;resonated significantly
            with a portion of the Georgian populace. This resonance was marked by high levels of engagement, indicating
            a deep-seated concern for preserving cultural heritage and cautiousness towards the adoption of foreign
            values perceived as incompatible with Georgian traditions.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">The analysis shows that these conservative narratives found a broad audience
            across various political parties, suggesting that conservative values are not the exclusive domain of any
            single political entity but are rather widespread across the political spectrum. Positive engagement with
            these narratives often came from individuals and groups advocating for a return to or preservation of
            traditional norms and values, viewing them as fundamental to the nation&#39;s identity and social cohesion.
            On the other hand, the negative engagement highlights a polarised society where progressive and conservative
            views clash over the direction in which Georgia should head, particularly on social issues. This tension
            mirrors wider global debates about nationalism, globalisation, and cultural preservation, indicating that
            Georgia&#39;s discourse on conservative values is both a reflection of internal dynamics and broader global
            trends. Despite these divisions, the engagement levels underscore an active participation in the democratic
            process, where social media serves as a crucial arena for the exchange of divergent views.</span></p>

    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">The discussion on economic outlooks in Georgia presents a varied picture of
            expectations, highlighting how political factions differ in their views on the country&#39;s economic
            future. Throughout this period, the Georgian Dream stood out for its optimistic stance, frequently sharing
            content that painted Georgia&#39;s economic situation in a positive light. The attention and interaction
            these posts received indicate they struck a chord with many, likely mirroring the party&#39;s attempt to
            promote its economic policies and achievements.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">Conversely, Strategy Aghmashenebeli took the lead in expressing economic concerns
            in 2020 and 2021, followed by the United National Movement (UNM) in 2023, and Girchi making its mark in
            2022. The engagement with Strategy Aghmashenebeli&#39;s posts early on suggests a sizable audience was
            receptive to their more critical view of Georgia&#39;s economic direction, focusing on potential issues or
            policy failures. The later prominence of UNM and Girchi in these discussions points to an ongoing evolution
            in who is most vocal in critiquing the economy, reflecting shifting political landscapes and the importance
            of economic issues in public debate.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">This overview paints a picture of a deeply divided economic narrative within
            Georgian politics, with Georgian Dream&#39;s consistent optimism met with varying sources of scepticism over
            the years. The interaction with these differing viewpoints underscores the significance of economic topics
            in the political arena and illustrates how parties leverage these discussions to rally support, challenge
            the status quo, or influence how Georgia&#39;s economic future is perceived.</span></p>

    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">The discussion on the Russia-Ukraine conflict in Georgia, framed through
            expressions of support for Ukraine and sympathy towards Russia, offers insight into the engagement of
            Georgian political parties on this issue. The United National Movement (UNM) has been notably vocal in its
            support for Ukraine, especially in 2020 and 2021, with a significant increase in activity in 2022, totalling
            400 posts. This pattern of advocacy underscores the UNM&#39;s consistent position on the conflict, echoing
            wider global backing for Ukraine.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">By 2023, Strategy Aghmashenebeli stepped up as the leading voice for Ukraine with
            205 posts, marking a heightened focus on the conflict. This uptick in activity could signify growing
            concerns or a deliberate shift in how Georgian political narratives engage with the situation. On the other
            hand, expressions of sympathy towards Russia saw People&#39;s Power and the Conservative Party of Georgia as
            principal contributors in 2023 and 2022, though their contributions were less frequent compared to those
            supporting Ukraine. The interaction with pro-Ukraine narratives indicates strong public and political
            interest in the conflict, highlighting its significance in Georgian political dialogue and the divisive
            effect of international disputes on national politics.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">This review highlights the shifting and active involvement of Georgian political
            parties in the discourse on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, mirroring wider international stances and domestic
            political considerations.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <h5 class="c32" id="h.fal1mxkq93"><span class="c21 c30">Ukraine Support</span></h5>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">The analysis of pro-Ukraine posts in Georgian political discourse, focusing on
            those with the highest levels of engagement, illuminates a significant portion of Georgian society&#39;s
            stance towards Ukraine, especially in the context of its conflict with Russia. The engagement patterns
            suggest a strong sense of solidarity with Ukraine across multiple political parties, although the intensity
            and nature of this support varied. Notably, posts demonstrating a firm stance in support of Ukraine&#39;s
            sovereignty and its European aspirations garnered substantial positive engagement, reflecting a widespread
            pro-European sentiment among Georgians and a clear opposition to Russian aggression.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c23">Throughout the period, it was observed that positive engagement primarily came
            from individuals and groups advocating for Georgia&#39;s alignment with European and Euro-Atlantic
            structures, viewing Ukraine&#39;s struggle as parallel to their aspirations for independence and territorial
            integrity. Conversely, the negative engagement with Pro-Ukraine posts, though less prevalent, pointed to
            existing segments within Georgian society that either harbour scepticism towards the West or prefer a more
            cautious approach to Georgia&#39;s foreign policy, especially concerning Russia. This dichotomy in
            engagement reflects the broader debates within Georgia regarding its foreign policy orientation and the
            balancing act between its historical ties to Russia and its aspirations towards the West. The analysis
            underscores the role of social media as a battleground for these competing narratives, with political
            parties leveraging these platforms to align with or challenge the prevailing sentiment towards Ukraine and,
            by extension, Georgia&#39;s geopolitical orientation. </span></p>
    <h5 class="c32" id="h.ctau47s37605"><span class="c21 c30">Russia Sympathy</span></h5>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">The analysis of Pro-Russia posts across different political parties in Georgia,
            with a focus on those eliciting the highest positive and negative engagement, reveals nuanced public and
            political reactions. Throughout the period, a pattern emerged where certain parties consistently produced
            content that resonated with pro-Russian sentiments, drawing both significant support and opposition. The
            data indicates that these narratives did not exclusively belong to any single party but were rather
            distributed among several, suggesting a complex landscape of opinions on Russia within Georgian political
            discourse.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17">In years where geopolitical tensions were heightened, posts that supported
            Russia&#39;s stance, particularly regarding Ukraine, tended to receive a notable amount of engagement,
            indicating a polarised public opinion. Positive engagement often comes from segments of the population that
            either hold cultural or historical affinities with Russia or are influenced by the geopolitical narratives
            that favour Russian partnership over Western integration. Conversely, the negative engagement highlighted a
            substantial part of Georgian society firmly opposed to Russia&#39;s actions in Ukraine and sceptical of any
            pro-Russian stance, emphasising the importance of Georgia&#39;s Euro-Atlantic integration. The distribution
            of engagement across parties underscores a fragmented political spectrum where pro-Russian narratives are
            both a point of mobilisation and contention. This polarisation is reflective of the broader geopolitical
            dilemmas facing Georgia, caught between its historical ties to Russia and its aspirations for closer
            relations with the West. &#8203;</span></p>

    <h4 class="c16" id="h.lmjv4ygdq8v0"><span class="c21 c8">Media independence and the role of media in political
            processes</span></h4>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">The conversation about media independence and its influence on political processes
            in Georgia, which contrasts views promoting Media Freedom against those favouring Media Censure, reveals a
            complex field of political activity spanning from 2020 to 2023. Lelo made an early mark as a proponent of
            media freedom in 2020, contrasting with the positions of the Georgian Dream and the Conservative Party of
            Georgia, which later emerged more closely aligned with views that seemed to endorse media censure. Georgian
            Dream&#39;s involvement is particularly noticeable in 2021 and 2022, marking a period of sustained focus on
            media issues from a stance that has faced criticism for leaning towards restricting media freedoms.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">Throughout 2021 and 2023, the United National Movement (UNM) displayed strong
            support for media freedom through numerous posts and significant interaction, emphasising the party&#39;s
            commitment to safeguarding media independence as a fundamental element of a democratic society. The
            prominent shift in 2023, with the Conservative Party of Georgia taking the forefront of the narrative
            against media freedom, highlights a growing division regarding the media&#39;s place in Georgia, mirroring
            wider anxieties about press freedom, governmental media interference, and the stakes for democratic
            processes.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">This overview points to a battleground over media freedom in Georgia, with the UNM
            championing the cause against a backdrop of broader debates on the subject. The level of engagement with
            these discussions underlines the importance and contentious nature of media independence issues, signifying
            that debates over media freedom continue to be a vital, yet polarising, aspect of Georgia&#39;s political
            dialogue.</span></p>

    <h4 class="c16" id="h.7iu07oauc3o0"><span class="c21 c8">Georgia&#39;s role in the conflict between Russia and
            Ukraine</span></h4>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">The discussion on how Georgia should navigate its position regarding the
            Russia-Ukraine conflict, framed through the debate on whether to offer more or less support to Ukraine, has
            vividly outlined political divisions from 2020 to 2023. The United National Movement (UNM) has been at the
            forefront of advocating for more support for Ukraine, ramping up its efforts in 2022 with 176 posts and
            continuing with a significant presence in 2023 through 65 posts. This continuous push aligns with the
            UNM&#39;s broader international stance, showcasing a commitment to standing with Ukraine during these
            challenging times.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">Conversely, the conversation around offering less support to Ukraine or showcasing
            anti-Ukraine sentiments has seen different parties take the lead at various times. The Georgian Dream was
            more noticeable in this aspect in the earlier years, though with fewer posts, while People&#39;s Power
            emerged strongly in 2023 with 86 posts. This change, notably People&#39;s Power&#39;s rise in activity,
            suggests shifting viewpoints within Georgia about how it should engage with the ongoing conflict.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9">This exploration reveals the lively and polarised nature of discussions on
            Georgia&#39;s foreign policy direction, especially about Ukraine. The marked increase in UNM&#39;s efforts
            to bolster support for Ukraine, paired with People&#39;s Power presenting an opposing viewpoint, mirrors the
            larger geopolitical strains and their impact on the political dialogue within Georgia.</span></p>

    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c23">In this section, showcase findings from our analysis, achieved through a
            strategic combination of fine-tuned and foundational Large Language Models (LLMs). This approach enabled us
            to distil complex narratives and discourses from a vast corpus of social media data, reflecting the
            intricacies of political polarisation in Georgia. By first classifying texts from various political entities
            based on polarisation discourse and then applying information extraction techniques, we leveraged the
            LLMs&#39; capabilities to uncover detailed narratives. This methodology allowed for an in-depth examination
            of how different political parties engage with and contribute to polarisation, providing insight into the
            evolution of political narratives within the specified timeframe. Through this process, we offer a nuanced
            view of the qualitative dynamics at play, illustrating the power of combining advanced computational tools
            for a comprehensive analysis of political discourse.</span></p>

        <li class="c1 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c22 c27">Critique of Liberal Media:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The
                party criticises the liberal Georgian media, implying that they are disturbed by the rise of
                conservative viewpoints and the success of conservative movements like Alt-info.</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c22 c27">Advocacy for Conservative Laws:</span><span
                class="c2">&nbsp;The narratives express satisfaction with the planned adoption of laws that align with
                conservative values, such as prohibiting LGBT propaganda. They see this as a victory for conservative
                ideology and a reversal of what was once dismissed as hateful rhetoric.</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c22 c27">Emphasis on Changing Times and Ideological
                Shift:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The party highlights a rapid shift in the political and ideological
                landscape, asserting that conservatives are gaining influence and will soon be setting the agenda in the
                country, in contrast to liberals.</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c22 c27">Perception of Persecution and Vindication:</span><span
                class="c2">&nbsp;They perceive past criticisms of their views as persecution and now see their
                once-marginalised positions being turned into law, viewing this as vindication of their long-standing
                fight for conservative values.</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c22 c27">Projection of Future Conservative Dominance:</span><span
                class="c27 c23 c49">&nbsp;The Conservative Party of Georgia projects confidence that conservative
                ideologies will soon dominate the political landscape, forcing the political elite to align with their
                agenda and values.</span></li>

    <h3 class="c14 c5" id="h.2ii1p3gkpadz"><span class="c8 c46">Limitations</span></h3>
    <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c23">While this study provides valuable insights into political polarisation in
            Georgia through the lens of social media discourses, there are certain limitations to consider. The data was
            sourced exclusively from official channels. These channels often exercise caution in their postings,
            potentially omitting the most polarised statements. As a result, our dataset might not capture the full
            spectrum of polarised sentiments prevalent in the broader social media landscape. To gain a more
            comprehensive understanding of the situation, it would be beneficial to incorporate media monitoring. Such
            an approach would likely unearth additional nuances and insights that official channels might overlook or
            deliberately exclude. This broader perspective could offer a more holistic view of the political
            polarisation in the region.</span></p>
