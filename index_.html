From The Aislers Set’s analog garage pop to Glenn Donaldson’s polychromatic kitchen pop; from the first entry in Stereolab’s Switched On series to Veronica Falls’ gorgeous juxtaposition of sweet and sinister, the Bay Area label’s archives are a treasure trove of melodic, inventive guitar music and its adjacent acquaintances.“Slumberland was started in 1989 to document the weird, primitive music that a small group of friends were making in various combinations/configurations,” says Schulman, who played in one such configuration: Black Tambourine. Although his label would quickly grow to document less primitive, less weird music—one Velocity Girl track was deemed palatable enough for the teen comedy Clueless, and Frankie Rose’s masterpiece Interstellar is as expansive as they come—Schulman has never diverted from this initial aim.“The process for me hasn’t really changed,” he says. “I work mostly with friends, or friends of friends—the personal connection is key. I’m generally turned off by excessive ambition; I like people for whom making music seems like an urgent undertaking.” Never boasting a flagship band or bands, Slumberland is underpinned by this equitable DIY ethos. -->
