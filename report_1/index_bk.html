            <h1>Exploring Political Polarization in Georgia: A Social Media-Based Analysis of Key Discourses and Contributing Factors using LLM</h1>
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                <h3>Data Collection</h3>
                In the present study, data was meticulously collected from a total of 154 public social media accounts associated with various political parties and their members. Employing a carefully curated methodology, we monitored these accounts to examine the nature and extent of political polarization in Georgia. Our dataset encompasses a broad time frame, stretching from 2021 to March 2023, and comprises a total of 120,000 posts sourced from four prominent social media platforms, namely Facebook, YouTube, Telegram, and Vkontakte. By scrutinizing such a diverse range of accounts and platforms, we ensured that our analysis accounts for a comprehensive perspective on the evolving patterns of political polarization within the state's digital landscape.
    Political parties coverd in the study:<br/><br/>
    <ul>
        <li> ● Georgian Dream</li>
        <li> ● United National Movement</li>
        <li> ● For Georgia</li>
    <li> ● Girchi</li>
    <li> ● Girchi More Freedom</li>
    <li> ● For People</li>
    <li> ● Strategy Agmashenebeli</li>
    <li> ● LELO</li>
    <li> ● DROA</li>
    <li> ● European Georgia</li>
    <li> ● Mokalakeebi</li>
    <li> ● Conservative Movement</li>
    <li> ● People's Power</li>
    <li> ● Aliance of Patriots</li>
    <li> ● Labour Party</li>
    <li> ● ERI</li>
    </ul>
        <h3>Polarisation discourses</h3>
                In our analysis, we identified ten key discourses of polarization within Georgia's political landscape, leveraging topic labeling and entity extraction techniques. For each discourse, we selected two opposing narrative groups to comprehensively examine the diverse perspectives driving polarization. The selected discourses include:
                <br/><br/>
                <ul>
    <li> ● The 2008 August war between Russia and Georgia</li>
    <li> ● The conflict between Russia and Ukraine</li>
    <li> ● Georgia's role in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine</li>
    <li> ● The custody and treatment of Mikheil Saakashvili</li>
    <li> ● The confrontation between liberal and conservative values</li>
    <li> ● Pro-Western versus Anti-Western foreign policy</li>
    <li> ● Pro-Russian versus Anti-Russian foreign policy</li>
    <li> ● The role of NGOs in the country's political processes</li>
    <li> ● Media independence and the role of media in political processes</li>
    <li> ● The influence of oligarchs in political processes</li>
</ul><br/>
By examining these discourses, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics shaping political polarization in Georgia and the underlying factors driving these divisive narratives.

                <h3>Data Annotation</h3>
                For the data annotation process, 26 master's students from Tbilisi State University and ILIA University, specializing in Political and Social studies, were selected to perform the text annotation exercise. In total, 42,000 annotation points were generated, covering 5,000 unique posts from the collected dataset. To ensure the quality and reliability of the annotated text examples, each post was independently annotated by four different annotators, mitigating the risk of bias or misinterpretation. The annotated examples were subsequently utilized to train the text classification models, as well as validate the accuracy of the discourse and narrative prediction models, ultimately strengthening the rigor and robustness of our analytical framework.
                
                <h3>Classification Models</h3>
                    In order to effectively address the text and entity classification tasks, three pre-trained models were chosen for our analysis: BERT-Multilingual, XLM-RoBERTa, and Electra-Ka. These models were fine-tuned using a multi-class, multi-label architecture, leveraging the collected dataset for an optimized performance on our specific task. To provide a thorough understanding of the training process and outcomes, the scores for the model training exercises are detailed in the table below.

Although his label would quickly grow to document less primitive, less weird music—one Velocity Girl track was deemed palatable enough for the teen comedy Clueless, and Frankie Rose’s masterpiece Interstellar is as expansive as they come—Schulman has never diverted from this initial aim.“The process for me hasn’t really changed,” he says. “I work mostly with friends, or friends of friends—the personal connection is key. I’m generally turned off by excessive ambition; I like people for whom making music seems like an urgent undertaking.” Never boasting a flagship band or bands, Slumberland is underpinned by this equitable DIY ethos. -->
