            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <div class="p-r-print">
            <p>This investigation delves into political polarization in Georgia, examining social media discourses and
                influential factors using machine learning methodologies grounded in language models. In line with the
                European Union's recommendations to the Georgian government, the study aims to monitor and assess the
                country's efforts to decrease polarization as part of its EU integration process. We amassed a dataset
                of 120,000 posts from 154 social media accounts linked to diverse political parties, originating from
                four leading platforms. By dissecting ten primary polarization discourses, we scrutinized opposing
                narratives fueling polarization. We applied 42,000 annotation points from 5,000 distinctive posts to
                develop and validate text classification models. The study employed three pre-trained
                models—BERT-Multilingual, XLM-RoBERTa, and Electra-Ka—for accurate classification and analysis of
                Georgia's political polarization discourse and narratives.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>Since its independence, Georgia has consistently expressed its European aspirations, which are enshrined
                in the Georgian Constitution and supported by the country's citizens and political spectrum. The
                Georgian government's commitment to progress on its European path is exemplified by its initial
                intention to submit an EU membership application in 2024. In response to the European Union's
                recommendations, this study aims to monitor Georgia's efforts to reduce political polarization, a
                critical aspect of the country's integration process. By analyzing social media discourses and key
                factors contributing to polarization, we hope to provide valuable insights into Georgia's progress
                toward meeting the EU's expectations and fostering a more inclusive and cooperative political landscape.
            </p>
            <p>This research offers valuable insights into Georgia's political polarization, delving into discourses and
                influential factors through social media-based analysis. By leveraging state-of-the-art language
                models and machine learning methodologies, we were able to examine a comprehensive dataset spanning
                multiple platforms and political parties. Our findings underscore the importance of continued efforts in
                reducing political polarization in Georgia, aligned with the EU's recommendations, to facilitate the
                country's integration process and promote a more inclusive political climate. This study provides a
                solid foundation for future research on Georgia's political landscape and serves as a useful model for
                analyzing polarization in other contexts.</p>

            <h3>Methodology and Data Collection</h3>

            <p>The methodology employed in this study involved a thorough examination of data collected from diverse
                social media accounts associated with various political parties and their members. In total, 154 public
                accounts were carefully monitored using a rigorous selection process, which facilitated the analysis of
                political polarization in Georgia. The dataset encompassed posts published between 2021 and March 2023,
                amounting to 120,000 posts extracted from four major social media platforms: Facebook, YouTube,
                Telegram, and Vkontakte. This comprehensive approach to data collection allowed for a wide-ranging
                perspective on Georgia's political landscape, ensuring a balanced representation of political opinions
                and ideologies.</p>

            Two additional discourses Law against foreign agents, and Sanctions against Georgian Court members, will be
            added in the next phase of the study.
            <h3>Data Annotation</h3>

            <p>To facilitate a robust data annotation process, 26 master's students from Tbilisi State University and
                ILIA University, with a focus on Political and Social studies, were chosen to partake in the text
                annotation exercise. This exercise produced a total of 42,000 annotation points, addressing 5,000 unique
                posts from the collected dataset. To guarantee the quality and reliability of the annotated text
                examples, each post was independently annotated by four distinct annotators. This strategy minimized the
                risk of bias or misinterpretation, leading to a more objective analysis. The annotated examples were
                then used to train the text classification models, as well as to validate the accuracy of the discourse
                and narrative prediction models, thus reinforcing the rigor and robustness of our research framework.
            </p>

            <h3>Classification Models</h3>
            <p>We used several pre-trained models for our text and entity classification tasks, including BERT-Multilingual, XLM-RoBERTa, and Electra-Ka. We fine-tuned these models with our dataset to best suit our requirements. Additionally, we employed the foundational models of GPT3.5 and GPT4 in our final analysis, which provided superior accuracy. The F1 scores for each model are presented in the table below:</p>
<table class="inline-table">
    <tr>
        <th>Model</th>
        <th>F1 Score for original posts in Georgian</th>
        <th>F1 Score for post translated in English</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>BERT-Multilingual</td>
        <td>0.67</td>
        <td>0.73</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>XLM-RoBERTa</td>
        <td>0.68</td>
        <td>0.71</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Electra-Ka</td>
        <td>0.70</td>
        <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>GPT3.5</td>
        <td>0.68</td>
        <td>0.88</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>GPT4</td>
        <td>0.71</td>
        <td>0.91</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>As the results indicate, GPT3.5 and GPT4 achieved superior performance in our analysis, guiding our final decision.</p>

            <h3>Discussion and Implications</h3>

            <p>The findings of this study provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics shaping
                political polarization in Georgia, including the key factors driving these divisive narratives. By
                examining the identified discourses and opposing narrative groups, we have illuminated areas where
                cooperation and collaboration between political parties can be encouraged, as recommended by the EU.</p>

            
            <div class="pagebreak"> </div>
                <h3>Limitations</h3>
                
                <p>
                    While this study provides valuable insights into political polarization in Georgia through the lens of social media discourses, there are certain limitations to consider. Firstly, the data was sourced exclusively from official channels. These channels often exercise caution in their postings, potentially omitting the most polarized statements. As a result, our dataset might not capture the full spectrum of polarized sentiments prevalent in the broader social media landscape. Secondly, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the situation, it would be beneficial to incorporate media monitoring. Such an approach would likely unearth additional nuances and insights that official channels might overlook or deliberately exclude. This broader perspective could offer a more holistic view of the political polarization in the region.
                </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

            
                <p>Our analysis reveals that Georgia has made some strides in addressing political polarization, with
                    tangible progress evident in specific discourses. However, further efforts are needed to ensure robust
                    cooperation and mutual understanding across the political landscape. The country's ongoing commitment to
                    EU integration requires addressing the root causes of polarization, fostering a more inclusive political
                    environment, and strengthening democratic institutions.</p>

                The study was conducted in two distinct stages, with each stage focusing on different discourses and timeframes. During the first stage, we concentrated on four polarization discourses, analyzing social media data from January 1st, 2023, to April 1st, 2023. This phase laid the groundwork for understanding the emerging trends and patterns of polarization in the Georgian political landscape.
                <br/><br/>
                In the second stage, which is currently planned, we aim to expand the scope of our analysis by including all 10 polarization discourses. Furthermore, we intend to incorporate transcriptions from video content and broaden the dataset to cover a more extensive timeframe, spanning from January 1st, 2021, to June 1st, 2023. This comprehensive approach will enable a deeper exploration of the intricacies of political polarization in Georgia, providing valuable insights into the underlying factors that contribute to its persistence. By analyzing an extended period, the second stage will offer a better view of polarization dynamics over time, illuminating how these discourses have evolved and their potential impact on Georgia's political climate.

            <!-- <p>Over the past 30 years, Mike Schulman’s one-man operation has dispatched an enormous volume of quietly influential records. From The Aislers Set’s analog garage pop to Glenn Donaldson’s polychromatic kitchen pop; from the first entry in Stereolab’s Switched On series to Veronica Falls’ gorgeous juxtaposition of sweet and sinister, the Bay Area label’s archives are a treasure trove of melodic, inventive guitar music and its adjacent acquaintances.“Slumberland was started in 1989 to document the weird, primitive music that a small group of friends were making in various combinations/configurations,” says Schulman, who played in one such configuration: Black Tambourine. Although his label would quickly grow to document less primitive, less weird music—one Velocity Girl track was deemed palatable enough for the teen comedy Clueless, and Frankie Rose’s masterpiece Interstellar is as expansive as they come—Schulman has never diverted from this initial aim.“The process for me hasn’t really changed,” he says. “I work mostly with friends, or friends of friends—the personal connection is key. I’m generally turned off by excessive ambition; I like people for whom making music seems like an urgent undertaking.” Never boasting a flagship band or bands, Slumberland is underpinned by this equitable DIY ethos.</p> -->

            <h2>Mikheil Saakashvili's custody and treatment</h2>
            <!-- <p>Over the past 30 years, Mike Schulman’s one-man operation has dispatched an enormous volume of quietly influential records. From The Aislers Set’s analog garage pop to Glenn Donaldson’s polychromatic kitchen pop; from the first entry in Stereolab’s Switched On series to Veronica Falls’ gorgeous juxtaposition of sweet and sinister, the Bay Area label’s archives are a treasure trove of melodic, inventive guitar music and its adjacent acquaintances.“Slumberland was started in 1989 to document the weird, primitive music that a small group of friends were making in various combinations/configurations,” says Schulman, who played in one such configuration: Black Tambourine. Although his label would quickly grow to document less primitive, less weird music—one Velocity Girl track was deemed palatable enough for the teen comedy Clueless, and Frankie Rose’s masterpiece Interstellar is as expansive as they come—Schulman has never diverted from this initial aim.“The process for me hasn’t really changed,” he says. “I work mostly with friends, or friends of friends—the personal connection is key. I’m generally turned off by excessive ambition; I like people for whom making music seems like an urgent undertaking.” Never boasting a flagship band or bands, Slumberland is underpinned by this equitable DIY ethos.</p> -->
